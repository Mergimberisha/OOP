# Intro to OOP

What is OOP,
Why OOP.

How to OOP

### Class
What is a class? A class is like a cookie cutter or blue print for objects but not the object itself.

What can you do with a cookie?
    - eat it!
    
# Methods
The actions or how an object behaves.

Son in the above example, .eat_cookie() could be a method inside the class Cookie

### Instance
What is an instance?

### Syntax
```python
class Dog():

    def __init__(self, attri1, attri2, optional_attri='default'):
    self.attribute_1 = attri1,
    self.attribute_2 = attri2,
    self.attribute_3 = optional_attri,

    def method_name(selfself, arg1):
    # complex block
    arg1 += arg1 + 1
    return arg1
```

### Convection


## OOP 4 Pillars

### Inheritance
The ability of a subclass to inherit all the behaviour and method from parent class.
One of the core reasons to use OOP, because it means you write less code. In reality this is debatable, has you end-up having to adapt a lot of methods. It also depends how good of a coder you are and ability to abstract effectively

### Abstraction
- Good naming
- Good documentation
- Use of inheritance

#### Polymorphism
- What is class polymorphism?
- What is method polymorphism?

#### Encapsulation
The ability to limit access from the exterior to method and or attributes.
Hence, making them ;private'.
